* My C- - Compiler
This project is for a school project. The goal is to design a C- - compiler (you can find the semantic of C- - here (french, sorry about that) : [[http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~goubault/CoursProgrammation/prog1_sem1.pdf]])

** Compile the project
To download and compile the project, make sure you have ocaml installed :
: sudo apt-get install ocaml

Then just do :
: git clone https://github.com/tobiasBora/compiler_project
: cd compiler_project
: make

** Compile your own C- - file
The mcc file given is the compiler. To run an example you can do for example
: cd Exemples/My_example
: ../../mcc try_to_kill_me.c
: ./try_to_kill_me

Please note that the integers are in 64 bits, so instead of using =%d= (in scanf or printf), prefer using =%llu= (if you don't, it works often, but can lead to some strange bug, especially with negative and big numbers).
